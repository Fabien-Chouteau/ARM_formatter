with ARM_Contents;
package ARM_Output is

    --
    -- Ada reference manual formatter (ARM_Form).
    --
    -- This package defines the abstract definition of an output object.
    -- Output objects are responsible for implementing the details of
    -- a particular format.
    --
    -- We use dispatching calls to call the formatter, so the details of
    -- formatting are insulated from the code that reads the source and
    -- determines the details of the text.
